I am a researcher in cosmologist at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/contatti/rubrica?ruolo=1&checkout=cerca&detail=Y&persona=renzi&key=5F749F2E49E4888AE8B2F471823535B3).
My work is at the crossroads of Cosmology, High Performance Computing and Data Analysis.

I can program in Julia, Fortran, Python, C/C++ (in order of pleasure of writing :D).
